                <p>Hi! My name is Chaska Ananiev (Voyous) and I am an aspiring developer/network 
                engineer. I have been interested in computers ever since I was child and have been 
                programming and learning about computers my entire life. Recently, as of 2021 I 
                decided it was time to start properly learning and honing my craft, as opposed to 
                the messing around with code and computers without gaining a truly deep level of 
                understanding I had done previously. This webpage was created as a way to document
                my learning process and hopefully help inspire/teach someone who stumbles across it.</p>
